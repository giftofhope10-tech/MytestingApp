Close Testing Group – Full Project Specification

1. Overview
A web platform allowing developers to submit their apps for Google Play closed testing and testers to request access, verify identity, and complete a 14‑day test cycle.

2. Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication for email OTP)
- Hosting: Vercel
- No user login; only email OTP verification

3. Core Features

Developer:
- Submit app (name, link, email, package, icon)
- Email OTP verification (no tempmail allowed)
- Must accept a “Developer Promise Agreement”
- One active listing at a time
- Approve/Reject tester requests
- View tester progress (0–14 days)
- Listing completes after 14‑day cycle

Tester:
- Enter email → OTP verify
- Request access to app
- Wait for developer approval
- Access test link once approved
- Daily “I tested today” check‑in for 14 days
- Leave rating & feedback

4. Automated Logic
- Detect temp mail domains
- Developer cannot post second app until first cycle finishes
- Tester cannot test same app twice
- Auto increment testing day once per 24h
- Show countdown: 14 days progress bar

5. Frontend Pages

Home:
- List of apps
- App card (name, icon, rating, progress)

App Details:
- App info + link (locked until approved)
- Tester request form
- Rating section

Developer Submission:
- Form fields (app title, package, email, icon upload)
- Developer promise checkbox
- OTP email verification

Developer Dashboard:

6. Firebase Database Structure

developers (collection):
- developerEmail
- verified: true/false
- activeAppId

apps (collection):
- appId
- developerEmail
- name
- packageName
- playLink
- iconUrl
- createdAt
- status: active / completed
- rating: number

testerRequests (collection):
- testerEmail
- appId
- status: pending / approved / rejected
- days_tested
- last_test_date

7. Email OTP System
- Send 6-digit code via Firebase
- Code valid for 10 minutes
- Temp mail rejection

8. Security Rules
- Developer can only modify their own app data
- Tester can only update their own progress
- Public read allowed for apps list

9. Anti-Abuse Measures
- One developer → one active app
- One tester → one test request per app
- No duplicate email cycles
- Temp mail block list

10. After Completion
- Developers may create a new listing
- Testers receive badge “Completed Reviewer”
- Final rating added to app listing
